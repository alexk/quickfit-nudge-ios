# GitHub Repository Setup Guide for QuickFit Nudge

## Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Website (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `quickfit-nudge` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `QuickFit Nudge - Micro-workouts for busy people. Smart calendar integration finds perfect workout moments in your schedule.`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have our project)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/alexkoff/Projects/FitDadNudge

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quickfit-nudge.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Create Repository via GitHub CLI (If you have `gh` installed)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/alexkoff/Projects/FitDadNudge

# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create quickfit-nudge --public --description "QuickFit Nudge - Micro-workouts for busy people" --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Option 3: Manual Commands (Replace placeholders)

If you want me to run these commands for you, just let me know your GitHub username:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main

### 2024-01-09 - AI Assistant

**Commit SHA**: `initial-setup`
**Task ID**: `Epic 1.1, 1.2`
**Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress

**Work Completed**:
- Created project structure with proper folder organization:
  - `/Core` - Core functionality (Authentication, Storage, CloudKit)
  - `/Models` - Data models
  - `/Views` - SwiftUI views
- Implemented authentication foundation:
  - `AuthenticationManager` - Handles Sign in with Apple flow
  - `KeychainManager` - Secure credential storage
  - `CloudKitManager` - Backend integration
- Created core models:
  - `User` model with subscription status
- Built UI foundation:
  - `RootView` - Main navigation controller
  - `AuthenticationView` - Sign in with Apple UI
  - `MainTabView` - Tab bar navigation
  - `OnboardingView` - Permission requests flow
- Added Info.plist with all required permission descriptions

**Blockers**:
- CloudKit container needs to be created in Apple Developer account
- Bundle identifiers need to be configured in Xcode project
- Some circular dependencies between files need resolution

**Next Steps**:
- Configure Xcode project settings and capabilities
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Create SwiftLint configuration
- Implement proper error handling in authentication flow
- Add unit tests for authentication components

**Notes**:
- Used modern Swift patterns (async/await, @MainActor)
- Followed MVVM architecture as specified
- All views are SwiftUI-based
- Prepared for CloudKit integration but needs Apple Developer setup
